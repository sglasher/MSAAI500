## Project Intro/Objective ##
The goal of this project was to take housing data from Washington state from May to Early July of 2014 and create a model that will be able to predict the price of a home. The Null Hypothesis is that there exists no relationship between price and the other variables such that they would have an affect on a home's anticipated price. The Alternative Hpothesis is that some ,if not all, independent variables will effect the dependent variable price as a relationship does exist between them.
